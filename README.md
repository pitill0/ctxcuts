# ctxcuts

Portable context shortcuts for AI agent workflows.

`ctxcuts` is a tiny CLI for defining reusable context shortcuts like `:r`,
`:f`, `:s` or `:a` and expanding them into focused prompts for coding agents,
chat assistants, CLIs and custom workflows.

The goal is simple: stop repeating long prompts, avoid oversized always-on
context, and load only the task contract you need when you need it.

Think of it as an `.editorconfig` for agent context: small, local-first,
versionable and vendor-neutral.

## Tiny example

```bash
ctxc expand ":r src/player.py"
ctxc expand ":s src/auth.py --focus input-validation"
ctxc expand ":i web player stops after switching stations"
```

## Why?

Before:

```text
Please investigate why the web player sometimes stops after switching stations.
Do not patch anything yet. Look for lifecycle problems, race conditions and
browser audio edge cases. Give me likely causes first.
```

After:

```text
:i web player stops after switching stations --focus lifecycle
```

`ctxcuts` expands that tiny instruction into a reusable context contract.

## See the context gain

`ctxc stats` gives a lightweight estimate of how much reusable context is being
loaded from a tiny shortcut invocation.

```bash
ctxc stats ":r src/ctxcuts/cli.py"
```

Example output:

```text
           ctxcuts stats
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━┓
┃ Metric                   ┃ Value ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━┩
│ Shortcut input tokens    │     7 │
│ Expanded prompt tokens   │   113 │
│ Reusable context tokens  │   106 │
│ Typed portion            │    6% │
│ Reusable context portion │   94% │
│ Context budget           │   800 │
│ Budget used              │   14% │
└──────────────────────────┴───────┘
```

The estimate is intentionally simple. It is not a provider-specific billing
calculator. The useful signal is that most of the prompt comes from reusable,
versioned context instead of repeated manual typing.

## Install for local development

This project is designed for `uv`, but it uses a standard `pyproject.toml`.

```bash
uv sync
uv run ctxc --help
```

Without `uv`, any modern Python workflow that understands `pyproject.toml` should
work.

## Quick start

Create default context shortcuts in your repo:

```bash
ctxc init
```

List available shortcuts:

```bash
ctxc list
```

Expand a shortcut:

```bash
ctxc expand ":r src/app.py"
```

Validate a `.ctxcuts/` setup:

```bash
ctxc doctor
ctxc doctor --root examples/basic
```

`doctor` reports missing context files as errors and suspicious context issues
as warnings.

Show a shortcut context without expanding a full invocation:

```bash
ctxc show :r
ctxc show review
ctxc show --root examples/basic :s
```

Estimate token-ish savings:

```bash
ctxc stats ":r src/app.py"
```

Pipe into another tool:

```bash
ctxc expand ":r src/app.py" | codex
ctxc expand ":r src/app.py" | claude
ctxc expand ":r src/app.py" | aider
```

## Working from another root

Use `--root` when the `.ctxcuts/` directory lives somewhere else.

```bash
ctxc list --root examples/basic
ctxc expand --root examples/basic ":r src/app.py"
ctxc stats --root examples/basic ":r src/app.py"
```

This is useful for examples, monorepos, wrapper scripts and tools that invoke
`ctxc` from a different working directory.

## Default shortcuts

| Shortcut | Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `:r` | review | Review without editing |
| `:f` | fix | Fix a concrete issue with the smallest safe change |
| `:t` | tests | Work on tests, failures and regressions |
| `:d` | docs | Improve or generate documentation |
| `:s` | security | Look for security issues and unsafe assumptions |
| `:a` | audit | Perform a structured audit |
| `:q` | quality | Improve maintainability and long-term quality |
| `:p` | perf | Analyze performance, latency and bottlenecks |
| `:x` | explain | Explain before changing anything |
| `:m` | map | Build a compact map of a file, module or repo area |
| `:i` | investigate | Investigate an issue before proposing a fix |
| `:c` | commit | Prepare commit summary, diff review or changelog entry |

## Template variables

Context files can use tiny built-in placeholders:

```markdown
Target: {{ target }}
Focus: {{ focus | default: "bugs, regressions and edge cases" }}
Output: {{ output | default: "summary + findings + recommendation" }}
```

Then pass values from the shortcut invocation:

```bash
ctxc expand ":r src/app.py --focus security --output checklist"
```

Supported variables include:

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `target` | Free-form target text after the shortcut |
| `focus` | Value passed with `--focus` |
| `output` | Value passed with `--output`, or the configured default output |
| `mode` | Shortcut mode from `shortcuts.yml` |
| `shortcut` | Shortcut name from `shortcuts.yml` |

Pass generic variables into a context:

```bash
ctxc expand ":r src/app.py --var area=auth --var risk=high"
```

Then use them in context files:

```markdown
Area: {{ area | default: "general" }}
Risk: {{ risk | default: "unknown" }}
```

Generic variable names must start with a letter or underscore and may contain
letters, numbers and underscores. Built-in variables such as `target`, `focus`,
`output`, `mode` and `shortcut` cannot be overridden with `--var`.

The renderer is intentionally tiny and dependency-free. It supports
`{{ name }}` and `{{ name | default: "value" }}`. It is not Jinja.

## Config layout

```text
.ctxcuts/
├── shortcuts.yml
└── contexts/
    ├── review.md
    ├── fix.md
    ├── tests.md
    ├── docs.md
    ├── security.md
    ├── audit.md
    ├── quality.md
    ├── perf.md
    ├── explain.md
    ├── map.md
    ├── investigate.md
    └── commit.md
```

## Example config

```yaml
version: 1

defaults:
  prefix: ":"
  output: markdown
  token_budget: 800

shortcuts:
  r:
    name: review
    context: contexts/review.md
    description: Review code or text without modifying it.
    mode: read_only
```

## What ctxcuts saves

`ctxcuts` is designed to reduce:

- repeated typing
- duplicated prompt boilerplate
- oversized always-on context files
- copy/paste drift between team members
- unclear agent task modes

It does not promise:

- exact model-specific token counts
- automatic billing reduction in every provider
- autonomous agent orchestration
- embeddings, memory or vector search
- vendor-specific agent behavior

If your tool sends the fully expanded prompt to a model, those tokens still
exist. `ctxcuts` helps you keep that context focused, reusable and explicit.
Provider-side caching or external context loading can produce additional
savings, depending on the stack.

## Continuous integration

The repository includes CI workflows for both Gitea Actions and GitHub Actions:

```text
.gitea/workflows/ci.yml
.github/workflows/ci.yml
```

Both workflows run the same checks:

```bash
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run ruff check .
uv run pytest
uv run mypy src
uv build
```

## Philosophy

`ctxcuts` is not an agent framework.

It is closer to an `.editorconfig` for agent context:

- small
- local-first
- portable
- versionable
- vendor-neutral
- easy to delete

Shortcuts are not magic commands. They are portable context contracts.
